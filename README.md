# racewebsite
sample website
I got the design for the site from MarcLibunao: http://codepen.io/MarcRay/pen/vmJBn
I wanted a sticky header and this was one of the cooler examples I was able to find.  
I changed the background image and some of the styling on the text, but kept the framework of the site.  
I added in a button to call the date and time, as well as a button that begins the game in Javascript.
